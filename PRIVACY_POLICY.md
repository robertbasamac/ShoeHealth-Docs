## 2. Data Collection

Shoe Health requests access to specific data from **Apple Health** to provide accurate tracking and insights related to your running shoes and workouts:

- **Running Workouts** â€” distance, duration, and pace, used to estimate total shoe wear.  
- **Distance (Walking + Running)** â€” ensures precise tracking of cumulative activity per shoe.  
- **Step Count** â€” actively used in internal calculations to refine wear and distance statistics.  
- **Heart Rate** â€” displayed to the user for informational purposes only, not used in any calculations.  
- **Running Power** â€” presented as an optional performance metric for user reference only and not used in analytics or wear estimation.

You can grant or revoke these permissions anytime in your deviceâ€™s Apple Health settings.
